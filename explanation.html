    <p>To cook a great steak, start by choosing a good cut like <em>ribeye</em>, <em>strip</em>, or <em>filet</em>. Let the steak come to room temperatue for about 30 minutes so it cooks more <b>evenly</b>. Pat it dry with a paper towel, them season generously with salt <b>and</b> pepper on all sides. At this stage, you can also lightly coat it with oil to help with <em>browning</em>.</p>
    <p>Heat a heavy skillet or grill over high heat until it's very <b>hot</b>. Place the steak down and let it sear the other side, adjusting the heat if it starts to <em>smoke</em> too much. For extra flavor, you can add <em>butter</em>, <em>garlic</em>, and <em>herbs</em> to the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak as it finishes cooking.</p>
    <p>Use a meat thermometer to check doneness. Once it reaches your preferred temperature, transfer the steak to a plate or cutting board and let it rest for at least <b>5 - 10 minutes</b>. This allows the juices to redistribute through the steak. After it's done resting slice it open and enjoy.</p>
